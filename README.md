### What am I currently up to
#### Senior Research Scientist @ [Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai/), Canva, London, United Kingdom 
Researched Text-to-Image Generative Modelling, specifically:
* Multi-layer Image Decomposition and Generation
  
### Where I worked <3 

#### Research Scientist @ [Multimodal Generation, AI Theory Group, Noah's Ark](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/index.html), Huawei, London, United Kingdom 
Researched Text-to-Image Generative Modelling, specifically:
* Multi-layer Image Decomposition and Generation
* Video Understanding
* PEFT for LLMs and T2I

#### Research Assisstant @ [Amigo Lab](https://amigos.ai/), King's College London, London, United Kingdom
Researched One/Few-Shot(s) Active Learning Segmentation pipelines and how at-scale training can help their generalisation. 

#### PhD Candidate @ [Amigo Lab](https://amigos.ai/), King's College London 
Developing state-of-the-art generative models of the human brain and applying them for anomaly detection and disease progression modelling.
* We made the DALL-E of the human brain at MICCAI 2022.
* We created the first morphologically correct generative model of the human brain at MICCAI 2022.
* We extensively analised the usage of VQ-VAE + Transformer pipeline for anomaly detection. Work was published at MIDL and MICCAI.

#### Computer Vision Engineer @ [Gentian Ltd](https://www.gentian.io/), London, United Kingdom
Working for a greener future by:
* Developing Remote-Sensing Deep Learning models aimed at quantifying current state and future potential of cities' green roof.
* Creating insightful business inteligence for local authorities to decrease their carbon footprint.
