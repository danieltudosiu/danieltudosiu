# Where I am currently working ?
## Research Assisstant @ [Amigo Lab](https://amigos.ai/), King's College London, London, United Kingdom
Researching One/Few-Shot(s) Active Learning Segmentation pipelines and how at-scale training can help their generalisation. 
## Computer Vision Engineer @ [Gentian Ltd](https://www.gentian.io/), London, United Kingdom
Working for a greener future by:
* Developing Remote-Sensing Deep Learning models aimed at quantifying current state and future potential of cities' green roof.
* Creating insightful business inteligence for local authorities to decrease their carbon footprint. 
## PhD Candidate @ [Amigo Lab](https://amigos.ai/), King's College London 
Developing state-of-the-art generative models of the human brain and applying them for anomaly detection and disease progression modelling.
* We made the DALL-E of the human brain at MICCAI 2022.
* We created the first morphologically correct generative model of the human brain at MICCAI 2022.
* We extensively analised the usage of VQ-VAE + Transformer pipeline for anomaly detection. Work was published at MIDL and MICCAI.
